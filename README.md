# Python-AltaRica-generation-and-interpretation
A few codes enabling to generate long AltaRica models with python scripts and also reading the AltaRica results. The code can be used as a basis to developp different complex models.

The Script_Generation_Block_Model generates 5000 lines of AltaRica code. It models a satellite constellation and creates the variables enabling to study it's capacity performance over time.

The Script_Generation_Stochastique_Spec generates the corresponding specification file for the stochastique simulation tool of AltaRica 3.0.

The Script_Results_Interpretation enables to read the output .csv files from AltaRica and transforms the results in a formalised statistical manner.
