# This scrypt has been created by Benoit Saint-Georges in the context of a 
# student project at Ecole polytechnique in cooperation with Thales Alenia
# Space (TAS).
# 
# This scrypt generates the stochastique simulation specification file for 
# AltaRica 3.0 corresponding to the model generated for the project. The 
# corresponding model is a 60 satellite constellation from the model described 
# in the "Satellite Constellation End-of-Life Dependability assessment with 
# AltaRica 3.0" article published in Les Techniques de l'Ing√©nieur.
